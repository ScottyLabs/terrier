# Terrier Documentation

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link. Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

```
